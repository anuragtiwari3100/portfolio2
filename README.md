# Sneha Mahajan - Web Developer Portfolio

This is my portfolio showing the applications/projects I have worked on so far. 

It was created with ReactJS, SASS, React Router. I've experimented a bit with using [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) for animation and simple visual effects.

### Ideas:
1. I ran into GSAP when I found this super cool [cursor](https://codepen.io/clementGir/pen/RQqvQx) implementation by [Clement Girault](http://clementgirault.com/). I decided to dive in and understand more about the GSAP library and re-create the cursor and other animated SVG elements.

2. Font's and other icons have been used mainly via Google's free font and icon library. I've used [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) for the skill icons.
