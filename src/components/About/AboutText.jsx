          I am a full-stack web developer with a diverse background in industrial automation and controls engineering. Programming has always been the most engaging part of my career so far and I'm excited to take a deeper dive into it through web development. I have a preference for front-end development and enjoy the process of building interactive applications with a clean UI. I am a lifelong learner and passionate about solving problems through software development.
