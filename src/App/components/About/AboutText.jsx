        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Sneha. I am a full-stack web developer who also enjoys
          writing, good design and has a weakness for unfrosted vanilla cake. I
          have a background in industrial automation and electrical engineering.
          Programming was the one of the parts of my work that made me come
          alive and I decided it was time to dive into it headfirst. Web
          development is exciting because there's always so much more to learn.
          The prospect of building something that someone is going to interact
          with directly is satisfying and fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, I've loved exploring new concepts and technologies but the
          most interesting part has been learning the ways of a different
          programming language. I am also an artist and learning to code has
          felt a lot like making art. Anyone can do it, but to do it well you
          need practice, a lot of repetition and the willingness to experiment
          and break things. Only then will you truly understand the nature of a
          medium and with experience, use it to your advantage. I picked
          Javascript as my medium and its dynamic nature has been fascinating
          compared to the other strictly typed languages like ladder logic or
          MATLAB that I've used in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not have a clear preference for frontend vs backend development
          yet. As my projects will show, I enjoy both. However, I drool over
          good design so I'm a tiny bit partial in that sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from my funky sense of humour and sparkling personality, I bring
          many other things with me. I enjoy helping people succeed and solving
          problems. A 12 year electrical engineering career has strengthened my
          analytical skills and over time it has molded my ability to see a
          bigger picture. And...as my colleagues and friends will attest, I am
          easy to work with, and who doesn't appreciate that? ðŸ˜‰ I'd love to
          talk to you more about what I'm working on right now and how I could
          add value to your team.
